# Dynamic features — draft inventory (curate into `stardust/dynamic-features.md`)

One row per detected finding. Merge duplicates, drop noise, keep every axis honest. Columns: disposition = what we do · reproducibility = what it needs · status = where it stands (reference/triage.md).

## Triage

- **Ships autonomously (reproducibility `self`):** 0 row(s) — none.
- **One owner decision batch:** 6 row(s) — inspect the XHR, add a vendor row · which tags run on the new host; property ids.
- **Already delivered by the capture pipeline:** 3 row(s) — no work.
- **Host-bound on the target:** 0 of 0 probed API paths — the off-origin data work.

## Phases

- **tags** — 6
- **detect** — 2
- **media** — 1
